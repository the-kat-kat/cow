ok here's some brief notes you guys are confused:

 - react is cool because it can change the page (aka re-"render")
   whenever it needs to without having to manually refresh the page

 - useState is a fancy way of making a variable.
   ONLY USE IT if you need to change the buttons/writing
   on a page every time the variable changes
